              <h3>Rails Test Prescriptions</h3>
              <p>
        <em>Rails Test Prescriptions</em> is a comprehensive guide to testing
        Rails applications, covering Test-Driven Development from both a
        theoretical perspective (why to test) and from a practical perspective
        (how to test effectively). It covers the core Rails testing tools and
        procedures for Rails 2 and Rails 3, and introduces popular add-ons,
        including Cucumber, Shoulda, Machinist, Mocha, and Rcov.
